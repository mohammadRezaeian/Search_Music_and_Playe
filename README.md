Hi. This script can search for music and play it for you!

All you need to do is install MPlayer!

In **Debian-based** distributions:

sudo apt install mplayer

In **RedHat-based** distributions (like Fedora):

`sudo dnf install mplayer`

In **Arch-based** distributions:

`sudo pacman -S mplayer`

Exit the program with Ctrl+C :)

Thanks!
